# Bivariate-Visualizations-by-County
R code to create a Monthly Report to Congress Section that displays county maps, bar plots, histograms, and tables by race/ethnicty. These visualizations identify top 10 counties for COVID case rates with the largest racial and ethnic disparities. Visualizations are created for each racial/ethnic group with each group in its own sub-section of the report (approximately 5 subsections).
Code also includes advanced procedures of clustering (Jenk's Natural Breaks) and user-defined functions.
Clustering techniques (Jenk's Natural Breaks) are used to determine large and largest population size amoung counties in the US for that month.
